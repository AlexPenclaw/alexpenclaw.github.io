my seams are busted.&lt;br /&gt;
My righteous sense of reality&lt;br /&gt;
is rusted.&lt;br /&gt;
“Fact or fiction,”&lt;br /&gt;
a fallacy.&lt;br /&gt;
There is no ordered truth,&lt;br /&gt;
objectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggle and strain &lt;br /&gt;
to straighten out&lt;br /&gt;
the delusions and disappointments&lt;br /&gt;
that make me doubt&lt;br /&gt;
my mind and motive.&lt;br /&gt;
I meditate&lt;br /&gt;
on sense and sensorium&lt;br /&gt;
to satiate &lt;br /&gt;
heuristic hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wonder&lt;br /&gt;
what witchly powers womanhood brings&lt;br /&gt;
to make me doubt the manly things&lt;br /&gt;
and float above on feminine wings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Someone has been building a wall&lt;br /&gt;
down the center of the city. Pulleys&lt;br /&gt;
move bricks and tools up to the workers&lt;br /&gt;
on either side. I climbed&lt;br /&gt;
up the scaffolding, following the pulley&lt;br /&gt;
to a worker laying bricks.&lt;br /&gt;
I asked why he was building&lt;br /&gt;
the wall. He sighed, and said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know.” So I climbed back down&lt;br /&gt;
and packed my bag. At dawn, I left the city&lt;br /&gt;
by car, following the wall by way of the Westward&lt;br /&gt;
road alongside it. When I reached the edge of town&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the wall did not stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It continued down the highway, bisecting&lt;br /&gt;
towns and villages. And always there were worksers&lt;br /&gt;
on either side, building it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ceased following the wall when&lt;br /&gt;
I came to the coast and the road&lt;br /&gt;
stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wall didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is bisecting the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-smattering-of-poetry" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Smattering Of Poetry" />
      <published>2020-08-02T19:54:02-04:00</published>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/a-smattering-of-poetry">&lt;p&gt;Poetry has been something that I have been interested in ever since school. I love reading it, and I love to write it even more. My style varies wildly. Sometimes I like to use a more formal format like a villanelle, other times I use free verse. Recently, I have experimented with adding alliteration for my amusement. Poetry lets me play with the sound and music of the world of words. Its a wonderful, beautiful experiment in twisting the threads of language into a long, beautiful cord. And it can be an incredibly cathartic thing as well, allowing me to express feelings that would otherwise be hard to get across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few poems I recently sent in for a fellowship prize. I didn’t get chosen as a finalist, but I stand by the poems as works of art and a good example of the kind of writing I can do when I put my heart into my words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lies-my-brain-hs-told-me&quot;&gt;The Lies My Brain Hs Told Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I’m worthless,&lt;br /&gt;
a whiner,&lt;br /&gt;
that I am nothing,&lt;br /&gt;
nobody,&lt;br /&gt;
these are the lies my brain has told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That my work and words are pitiful,&lt;br /&gt;
worthless drivel,&lt;br /&gt;
that no one ever&lt;br /&gt;
enjoys them,&lt;br /&gt;
these are the lies my brain has told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That my politics are misguided,&lt;br /&gt;
that power thrives&lt;br /&gt;
and I, in my isolation&lt;br /&gt;
am impotent,&lt;br /&gt;
these are the lies my brain has told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That it would have been better&lt;br /&gt;
not to be a burden&lt;br /&gt;
and to relieve my parents&lt;br /&gt;
of my poverty,&lt;br /&gt;
these are the lies my brain has told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That nothing I do&lt;br /&gt;
will be of note&lt;br /&gt;
and I shall die unknown&lt;br /&gt;
and unloved,&lt;br /&gt;
these are the lies my brain has told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do not have to listen to them&lt;br /&gt;
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;eulogia-draconis&quot;&gt;Eulogia Draconis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pity the dragon that was slain&lt;br /&gt;
by a knight and cut in twain&lt;br /&gt;
for it was only acting by its nature,&lt;br /&gt;
at least according to its nomenclature:&lt;br /&gt;
drakkon, the serpent from the Earth,&lt;br /&gt;
which guards what the gods have deemed to be worth&lt;br /&gt;
more than a fool of noble birth.&lt;br /&gt;
So pity the dragon, for it knew better than I&lt;br /&gt;
which mortals should live and which should die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-glimpse-at-my-mind&quot;&gt;A Glimpse at My Mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts are hidden, but my words&lt;br /&gt;
are wanton things.&lt;br /&gt;
They demand to be shared&lt;br /&gt;
and spred around.&lt;br /&gt;
To write is to publicize,&lt;br /&gt;
to publish oneself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think on my words,&lt;br /&gt;
and wearily&lt;br /&gt;
I realize that, together,&lt;br /&gt;
they tangle me&lt;br /&gt;
in a net of my own devising&lt;br /&gt;
that they have drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my words may free me&lt;br /&gt;
from my fetters&lt;br /&gt;
if I only realize that the state&lt;br /&gt;
of sorrow&lt;br /&gt;
is but a temporary present, and not&lt;br /&gt;
a prophecy of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;abjuration-against-gender&quot;&gt;Abjuration Against Gender&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goddess, God, and every deity&lt;br /&gt;
of the Earth, the Sky, and the mighty Sea,&lt;br /&gt;
to your power I now surrender.&lt;br /&gt;
Free me from this thing called gender!&lt;br /&gt;
Let me be like the great oak tree,&lt;br /&gt;
unconcerned with what humans see,&lt;br /&gt;
and from these shackles let me be free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;herbal-remedies&quot;&gt;Herbal Remedies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some St. John’s Wort to heal the cut,&lt;br /&gt;
some chamomile tea to soothe the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basil leaves and honey yo keep the cough at bay,&lt;br /&gt;
motherwort to send the headache on its way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A balm of juniper berries to aid with gout,&lt;br /&gt;
Some rose water to help the liver out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spearmint compress for the feverish head&lt;br /&gt;
Some lavender oil to sleep soundly in bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herbs have I for cuts, bruises, fever and chills;&lt;br /&gt;
nothing have I for society’s ills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will likely post more poetry on this blog in the near future. Maybe I’ll even create chapbook of sorts to sell online. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my poetry, and I look forward to sharing more of it with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
