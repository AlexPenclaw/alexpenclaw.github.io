Hope you enjoy your stay!</p>","comment_id":"5f22c67505f92d3b0b4907d7","plaintext":"If you've been following my work for a while now, you know I've had a ton of\nblogs. None of them seem to last very long. My wordpress blog under my real name\nyears ago was probably the longest lasting. Every other blog, especially the\nones with a theme, has basically fizzled out after a while for one reason or\nanother. I really want a general purpose blog, however, and I feel like I could\ndefinitely use a place to talk about the proects I'm working on. So this is an\nattempt to create that.\n\nGoing forward, I want this to be my main hub for communicating with supporters\nand friends about what I'm up to. Eventually, I will add a subscription system\nfor bonus content for people who feel like giving me a bit of money each month.\nRight now, though, I think I should start by introducing myself and the projects\nI'm working on in case anyone stumbles upon this who doesn't know me.\n\nMy name is Alex Penclaw. I'm a panromantic, asexual, polyamorous and genderfluid\nindividual who prefers they/them pronouns. I like to write things, but I often\nhave trouble writing due to my chronic depression. I'm a member of the furry\nfandom, and my current main fursona is a dragon. Here is a picture of them:\n\nColors by me, Base by @SuperHensa on TwitterMy primary interests in terms of\nwriting and creativity are science fiction, fantasy and horror. Speculative\nfiction has been my first and truest love among the myriad genres of literature\nand media, and I never grow tired of finding new gems within that vast expanse\nof stories and art. In fact, I'm working on a science fiction audio drama\npodcast called Librarium Stellaris which follows the voyages of the Galctic\nArchive Ship Alexandria. Think Star Trek meets your local library (except gayer)\nand you have a pretty good idea of what the show will be like once I get to\nrecording it.\n\nI'm pretty active on the Fediverse, and I am even in the process of setting up\nmy own server running the Hometown fork of Mastodon\n[https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown]. The working title for the server is \nThe Orbital Cafe, and I even have a logo for it:\n\nThe general idea is for the instance to be focused on art, writing and other\ncreative pursuits. Hometown has some interesting features, including local-only\nposting so that people can discussions that are centered on the instance itself\nand that do not federate. Its a very interesting piece of software and I'm\nreally looking forward to getting the instance to be fully-operational.\n\nOverall, I am very excited and happy to have a new hub for all my projects as\nwell as a place to share all the random thoughts that enter my head. Welcome to \nThe Penclaw Press. Hope you enjoy your stay!","feature_image":null,"featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-07-30T13:09:09.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-30T14:35:27.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-30T14:35:27.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f22ea5f05f92d3b0b49084e","uuid":"e1d661fc-47a3-406a-8e98-aec2626b4f50","title":"About Alex","slug":"about-alex","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2020/08/Penclaw-Press-Logo.png\",\"width\":610,\"height\":610,\"alt\":\"Penclaw Press logo\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://efdn.club/@xandra\"]]],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Alex Penclaw is a blogger and writer of speculative fiction.

I didn't get\nchosen as a finalist, but I stand by the poems as works of art and a good\nexample of the kind of writing I can do when I put my heart into my words.\n\nThe Lies My Brain Hs Told Me\nThat I’m worthless,\na whiner,\nthat I am nothing,\nnobody,\nthese are the lies my brain has told me.\n\nThat my work and words are pitiful,\nworthless drivel,\nthat no one ever\nenjoys them,\nthese are the lies my brain has told me.\n\nThat my politics are misguided,\nthat power thrives\nand I, in my isolation\nam impotent,\nthese are the lies my brain has told me.\n\nThat it would have been better\nnot to be a burden\nand to relieve my parents\nof my poverty,\nthese are the lies my brain has told me.\n\nThat nothing I do\nwill be of note\nand I shall die unknown\nand unloved,\nthese are the lies my brain has told me.\n\nBut I do not have to listen to them\nanymore.\n\nEulogia Draconis\nPity the dragon that was slain\nby a knight and cut in twain\nfor it was only acting by its nature,\nat least according to its nomenclature:\ndrakkon, the serpent from the Earth,\nwhich guards what the gods have deemed to be worth\nmore than a fool of noble birth.\nSo pity the dragon, for it knew better than I\nwhich mortals should live and which should die.\n\nA Glimpse at My Mind\nMy thoughts are hidden, but my words\nare wanton things.\nThey demand to be shared\nand spred around.\nTo write is to publicize,\nto publish oneself.\n\nI think on my words,\nand wearily\nI realize that, together,\nthey tangle me\nin a net of my own devising\nthat they have drawn.\n\nBut my words may free me\nfrom my fetters\nif I only realize that the state\nof sorrow\nis but a temporary present, and not\na prophecy of tomorrow.\n\nAbjuration Against Gender\nGoddess, God, and every deity\nof the Earth, the Sky, and the mighty Sea,\nto your power I now surrender.\nFree me from this thing called gender!\nLet me be like the great oak tree,\nunconcerned with what humans see,\nand from these shackles let me be free!\n\nHerbal Remedies\nSome St. John’s Wort to heal the cut,\nsome chamomile tea to soothe the gut.\n\nBasil leaves and honey yo keep the cough at bay,\nmotherwort to send the headache on its way.\n\nA balm of juniper berries to aid with gout,\nSome rose water to help the liver out.\n\nA spearmint compress for the feverish head\nSome lavender oil to sleep soundly in bed.\n\nHerbs have I for cuts, bruises, fever and chills;\nnothing have I for society’s ills.\n\nI will likely post more poetry on this blog in the near future. Maybe I'll even\ncreate chapbook of sorts to sell online. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my poetry, and\nI look forward to sharing more of it with you soon.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1455390582262-044cdead277a?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-08-02T19:30:52.000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-02T19:54:02.000Z","published_at":"2020-08-02T19:54:02.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f27242005f92d3b0b490aac","uuid":"f7f06f6b-bb22-4304-aaa6-25260270b20e","title":"Members Only Poem: The Wall Bisecting","slug":"members-only-poem-the-wall-bisecting","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"## The Wall, Bisecting\\nSomeone has been building a wall\\ndown the center of the city.
